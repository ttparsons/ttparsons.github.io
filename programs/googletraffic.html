<h3>Google Traffic Grabber</h3>
<p>Now that Google has finally made their traffic information freely accessible through their <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/?hl=en" target="new">Directions API</a>, it's possible to use Tasker to let you know automatically know the time it will take you to go from point A to B in current traffic conditions (or even traffic predicted in the future). For those of you who are unfamiliar with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&amp;hl=en" target="new">Tasker</a>, it is an android app that lets you run powerful scripts on your android phone. It is quite similar to the website called <a href="https://ifttt.com/" target="new">If This Then That</a>.</p>
<p>What you can use this script to do is tell you the best route to get to work every day when you start your car, and how long it will take you in current traffic. It is especially useful if (like me) you can take several different ways to home/work so you never get caught in a traffic jam again!</p>
<h4>The Details</h4>
<p>The end product of this tutorial is 2 variables, one that gives you the &quot;summary&quot; name for the best route to work (for example, I-215) and the other gives the current time in traffic (for example, 18 minutes).</p>
<ol>
  <li>First, get a google maps API account here: <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/" target="new">https://developers.google.com/maps/</a><span data-text="[1] " title="press 1 to open link"> </span>Click &quot;Get Started&quot; and then click on Google Maps Android API. Then click on &quot;Get a Key&quot;. Create a new project and name it whatever you want. Generate an API key, and take note of it. From here on out, I will refer to this key as YOUR_API_KEY.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Side note: </strong>At some point, it may ask you to enter a credit card. I don't think you have to if you don't want to, but I think it gives you more free API requests per day. You shouldn't exceed the free 2,500 requests per day anyhow.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Click on the &quot;Overview&quot; button on the left tab (of the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/apis" target="new">API manager screen</a>), then expand the Google Maps APIs section. Click on &quot;Google Maps Directions API&quot;, and then enable it at the top. From here, you can also visit the USAGE tab to see how many requests you have made for directions, or visit the QUOTAS tab to limit your daily quota to the free amount so you never get billed (or, at least that's my understanding).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now you're all set to create your Tasker task to get the best route &amp; live traffic. Here's how (feel free to correct me if there's a better way to do any of this). Replace the starting and ending addresses to reflect where you want to go, and also put in your API key. You can also run a GET LOCATION task beforehand and then use %LOC as your origin rather than a real address.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<div id="codeblock">
<p>a. <strong>Variable Clear</strong></p>
<p><strong>Name</strong></p>
<p>%GMAPS</p>
<p>b. <strong>HTTP Get</strong></p>
<p><strong>Server:Port</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://maps.googleapis.com/">https://maps.googleapis.com:443</a><span data-text="[3] " title="press 3 to open link"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Path</strong></p>
<p>/maps/api/directions/json?origin=YOUR+STARTING+ADDRESS+AND+CITY&amp;destination=YOUR+ENDING+ADDRESS+AND+CITY<br />
&amp;travelmode=driving&amp;departure_time=now&amp;key=YOUR_API_KEY</p>
<p>c. <strong>Variable Set</strong></p>
<p>%GMAPS to %HTTPD</p>
<p>d. <strong>JavaScriptlet</strong></p>
<p><strong>Code</strong></p>
<p>var routeSplit = JSON.parse(global('GMAPS'));</p>
<p>var routetraffic = routeSplit.routes[0].legs[0].duration_in_traffic.text;</p>
<p>var routename = routeSplit.routes[0].summary;</p>
<p>e. <strong>Variable Set</strong></p>
<p>%RouteName to %routename</p>
<p>f. <strong>Variable Set</strong></p>
<p>%RouteTraffic to %routetraffic</p>
</div>
<br />
<p>And there you have it! You can now set up a task to speak to you (with, for example, &quot;Hello, you should take %RouteName to get to work the fastest. Expected time in traffic is %RouteTraffic&quot;) when you connect to your car's bluetooth. See my other section on the left for adding in an extra touch: Alternative Routes.</p>
